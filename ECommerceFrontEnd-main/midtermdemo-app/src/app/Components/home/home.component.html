      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>The online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly<br/>
      buy goods and services without any intermediary service over<br/>
      the internet. The goal of this website is to develop a web-based<br/>
      interface for eCommerce website, the website would be easy to <br/>
      use and hence the shopping experience pleasant for the users.</p>

      <p>The main goal of this website is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To develop an easy-to-use web-based interface where customers can<br/>
        search for products, view a complete description of the product and <br/>
        order the product.</li>
        <li>Reach out to a larger audience - interface access is becoming so<br/>
        mainstream now that your product/service can reach almost everyone<br/>
        on the planet with an internet - enabled device.</li>
        <li>Your virtual shop remains open and operational 24x7 even if you/your<br/>
        employee are not working - this might not be wholly true if your product<br/>
        is a service - which requires immediate human - intervention.</li>
      </ul>
